/**
 * This is a simple implementation of Minim requirements in order to be able to
 * use it outside Processing; in plain Java programs.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Minim instance = MinimImpl.getMinimInstance();
 *
 * Quote from Minim documentation:
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * If you are using Minim outside of Processing, then the constructor of Minim
 * requires an Object that can handle two important file system operations
 * so that it doesn¡¯t have to worry about details of the current environment.
 *
 * These two methods are:
 *      String sketchPath( String fileName )
 *      InputStream createInput( String fileName )
 *
 * These are methods that are defined in Processing,
 * which Minim was originally designed to cleanly interface with.
 * The sketchPath method is expected to transform a filename into an absolute path and
 * is used when attempting to create an AudioRecorder (see below).
 * The createInput method is used when loading files and is expected to take a filename,
 * which is not necessarily an absolute path, and return an InputStream that
 * can be used to read the file.
 * For example, in Processing, the createInput method will search in the data folder,
 * the sketch folder, handle URLs, and absolute paths.
 * If you are using Minim outside of Processing,
 * you can handle whatever cases are appropriate for your project.
